## Overview

MonoMind is an AI-powered development assistant designed to autonomously manage monorepos and complex codebases. It combines code analysis, build orchestration, testing, refactoring, and release management into a single intelligent CLI-driven interface.

### Key Features
- **Repository Analysis**: Scans repositories and builds dependency graphs
- **Impact Analysis**: Predicts the effect of changes on modules and tests
- **Build Orchestration**: Smart, incremental builds across monorepos
- **Test Orchestration**: Determines which tests to run based on code changes
- **Refactoring**: Safe rename, move, and restructure operations across languages
- **Release Management**: Versioning, changelog generation, and publishing
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extend functionality without modifying core code
- **Visualization**: Multiple formats including ASCII and HTML exports
