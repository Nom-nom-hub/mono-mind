## 2. Core Modules

### 2.1 CLI Controller

* Parses commands, flags, and subcommands.
* Routes to the appropriate module.
* Example commands:

```bash
mono analyze        # Scan repo, build dependency graph
mono impact <file>  # Show affected modules/tests for a change
mono build          # Incremental build based on changes
mono refactor       # Safe rename/move across modules
mono release        # Version bump, changelog, publish packages
```

---

### 2.2 Repository Analyzer

* Walks the repo recursively to detect modules/packages.
* Builds a **dependency graph**: nodes = modules, edges = imports/dependencies.
* Stores graph in memory and optionally serializes to JSON for caching.

**Algorithm:**

1. Parse files per language using Tree-sitter.
2. Extract imports/dependencies.
3. Generate directed graph; mark circular dependencies.
4. Store module metadata: file paths, last modified timestamp, language, dependencies.

---

### 2.3 Impact Analysis Engine

* Input: file or module change.
* Output: list of affected modules, tests, and potential conflicts.

**Algorithm:**

1. Look up changed file in dependency graph.
2. Traverse downstream nodes to find impacted modules.
3. Map modules to tests based on metadata/config.
4. Output CLI summary or optional JSON for automated pipelines.

---

### 2.4 Build & Test Orchestrator

* Incremental builds: rebuild only affected modules.
* Parallel execution: spawn worker threads/goroutines per independent module.
* Integrates with native build tools (npm, Maven, cargo, etc.) per language.

**Commands:**

```bash
mono build --dry-run   # Preview modules to build
mono build --parallel  # Parallelized build
mono test              # Run only impacted tests
```

---

### 2.5 Refactor Engine

* Multi-language refactoring using **AST parsing**.
* Supports:

  * Rename functions, classes, modules
  * Move files or folders safely
  * Update import paths automatically
* CLI dry-run mode to preview changes before committing.

---

### 2.6 Release & Version Manager

* Version bump per module or globally
* Changelog generation from commit messages
* Optional: publish to npm, PyPI, Maven, etc.

**Commands:**

```bash
mono release --bump minor
mono release --changelog
```

---

### 2.7 Plugin Architecture

* Core CLI provides hooks: `pre-build`, `post-build`, `pre-refactor`, `post-release`.
* Plugins are simple binaries/scripts loaded from a config folder.
* Enables community extension without touching core code.

---

### 2.8 Logging & Metrics

* Log every CLI action with timestamp, command, status, and duration.
* Store metrics for:

  * Build/test times
  * Refactor success/failures
  * Module impact stats

---

## 3. Data Structures

```rust
struct Module {
    name: String,
    path: PathBuf,
    language: Language,
    dependencies: Vec<String>,
    last_modified: DateTime,
}

struct RepoGraph {
    modules: HashMap<String, Module>,
    edges: HashMap<String, Vec<String>>,
}

struct ChangeImpact {
    changed_file: String,
    affected_modules: Vec<String>,
    affected_tests: Vec<String>,
}
```

---

## 4. Concurrency Model

* **File scanning:** parallel directory walk.
* **Dependency graph analysis:** parallel BFS/DFS on independent subgraphs.
* **Build & test orchestration:** spawn worker threads per module with dependency ordering.

---

## 5. CLI Example Workflow

```bash
# Step 1: Analyze repo and build dependency graph
mono analyze

# Step 2: Check impact of a file change
mono impact src/api/user.rs

# Step 3: Incremental build of affected modules
mono build --parallel

# Step 4: Safe refactor of a function
mono refactor --rename oldName newName --dry-run

# Step 5: Release new version with changelog
mono release --bump minor --changelog
```

---

## 6. MVP Scope

* **Phase 1:** Repo parsing, dependency graph, impact analysis, basic CLI commands.
* **Phase 2:** Incremental build, test orchestration, refactor engine for one language (e.g., JS or Python).
* **Phase 3:** Multi-language support, release management, plugin system, visualization.

---

## 7. Scalability & Maintenance

* Modular architecture: each component is independent.
* Incremental graph updates for speed.
* Easy to add new languages via Tree-sitter parsers.
* CLI-first: deployable as single binary; cross-platform.
