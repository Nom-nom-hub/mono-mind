An AI-powered development assistant designed to autonomously manage monorepos and complex codebases.

## Features

- **Autonomous Refactoring**: Safely rename, move, or restructure code across multiple languages.
- **Impact Analysis**: Predicts the effect of changes on modules, tests, and dependencies.
- **Dependency Optimization**: Detects unused, outdated, or conflicting packages.
- **Test Orchestration**: Determines which tests to run based on code changes.
- **Automated Build Management**: Smart, incremental builds across monorepos.
- **Release Management**: Versioning, changelog generation, and publishing to package registries.
- **CLI-First Interface**: Simple commands for all actions.
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extend functionality without modifying core agent.
