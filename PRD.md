Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Product Name: DevOps AI Agent (codename: MonoMind)
Author: Teck
Date: 2025-08-23
Version: 1.0

1. Purpose

MonoMind is an AI-powered development assistant designed to autonomously manage monorepos and complex codebases. Its goal is to accelerate developer productivity, reduce human error, and automate repetitive tasks in large-scale projects, while being fully operable by a single developer.

The agent combines code analysis, build orchestration, testing, refactoring, and release management into a single intelligent CLI-driven interface.

2. Target Users

Solo developers managing multiple projects or large codebases

Small teams that require rapid automation and dependency management

Open-source maintainers with multi-package repositories

Enterprises looking for offline, AI-assisted codebase management

3. Key Features
3.1 Core AI Capabilities

Autonomous Refactoring: Safely rename, move, or restructure code across multiple languages.

Impact Analysis: Predicts the effect of changes on modules, tests, and dependencies.

Dependency Optimization: Detects unused, outdated, or conflicting packages.

Test Orchestration: Determines which tests to run based on code changes.

3.2 Project Management Features

Automated Build Management: Smart, incremental builds across monorepos.

Release Management: Versioning, changelog generation, and publishing to package registries.

Environment Setup: Automatically configure dev environments, databases, and dependencies per project.

3.3 Developer Productivity Features

CLI-First Interface: Commands like mono analyze, mono refactor, mono impact, mono release.

Visualization: ASCII dependency graphs and optional HTML exports.

Plugin Architecture: Extend functionality (linters, deploy scripts, analytics) without modifying core agent.
